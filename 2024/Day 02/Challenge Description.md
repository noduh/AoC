# Day 02
## Problem Description
### Part 1
There are multiple *reports*. These reports have multiple numbers. A report is considered *safe* if it is continuously increasing or decreasing (not both), and if any two adjacent numbers differ by *at least* one and *at most* 3. Count how many reports are safe.

### Part 2
The problem is now changed so that if removing one number in a report makes it safe, that is now counted as safe. How many are safe now?
