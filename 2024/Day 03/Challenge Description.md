# Day 03
## Challenge Description
### Part 1
Given a very long string of numbers, take out only things that are `mul(x,y)` where `x` and `y` are 1-3 digit numbers. then add up the products of `x` and `y` in each valid instruction.

### Part 2
Using the same input, make it so `don't()` can *disable* the `mul()` function, and `do()` can re-enable it.
