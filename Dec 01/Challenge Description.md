## Problem Description
### Part 1
Compare the *distance* between two lists. This means comparing the two smallest numbers and getting the difference, then doing that with the second smallest, and so on to the end. Then the *total* distance is the result of adding up all the distances.

### Part 2
Create a *similarity score* which is done by going through each number in the first list and multiplying it by the number of times is appears in the second list. Then add up each similarity score to get a total score.
